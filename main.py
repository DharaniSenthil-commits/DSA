#Array
#An array is a powerful data structure that allows users to store and manipulate a collection of elements, all of the same data type in a single variable. Simply, it is a collection of elements of the same data type stored at contagious memory locations that can be randomly accessed with their index number

import array
arr=array.array("i",[1,2,3,4,5])
print(arr)
